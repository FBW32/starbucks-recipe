    <h1>Starbucs Cookies Recipe</h1>
    <p>I love them!  But in this COVID-19 epidemic time, we are not able to buy them from a Starbucks Store,you know. So, I found the ingredients from Starbucks web site and tryed it.</p> 
        <p>
        Delicious! Why don’t you just try to make them at home! I hope you like it as well.</p> 

    <h4>How many cookies does the recipe make?</h4>

        <p>The recipe below should make 12 large cookies. Feel free to use less dough per cookie and make smaller ones. Or make larger ones! It’s your call but using 1/3 cup of dough will give you 12.</p>
        
        <h4>Can I use a metal baking sheet for these chocolate chunk cookies?</h4>
        
        Yup! You can! I would suggest using a silicone baking sheet or a little baking spray. There is nothing worse then a cookie that sticks to the cookie sheet!</p>
